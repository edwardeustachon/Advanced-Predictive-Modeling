    "I had a conversation with a data scientist at Chevron who was a part of a team that was tasked to find low-hanging fruit and address such issues on short timelines, typically 6 months at the longest. Because the team was expected to provide solutions with such quick turnaround, they eventually realized that while they were solving a few business problems at a time, they did not solve enough problems at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy/oil and gas industry is an industry that collects tremendous amounts of data every day, between the company trading floor, refineries, and pipelines the stream of data is almost endless. The team could only tackle a few problems at a time often in only one area of the company. As such, Chevron would later establish another team within the data science department that tackled longer horizon projects and sought to address incoming issues while the other team continued to solve what problems they could.\n",

    "Because lasso and ridge penalize terms based on the size of the weights we need to scale our data. The shrinking would not be fair otherwise since the optimization problem relies on minimizing the MSE and larger weights by magnitude will contribute to the penalty by a larger than intended amount."

    "We expect the training error of the model to be downward sloping; i.e as number of data points increases the model decreases in training error. However, test error is generally U-shaped where we expect test error to decrease to a certain point before increasing again as the number of data points increases.\n",

    "This is because as we increase the number of examples the model will begin to 'overfit'. The model will begin to interpret random noise as a signal. We displayed such an example in our Thursday lecture where a high degree polynomial fits to the data points perfectly, but the curve is too wobbly and thus not indicative of the true data-generating process we expect."
